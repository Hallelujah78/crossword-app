# AI For Everyone

## What is AI?
### Vid 1: Introduction
- AI value creation
    - $13-22 trillion by 2033 McKinsey
    - more value from supervised learning than from generative AI
    - lots of value outside software industry
        - retail, travel, transport & logistics etc
        - hairdressing is an example of a job that will be least affected by AI
- Demysitfying AI
    - AI comprises separate ideas
        - ANI - artificial narrow intelligence
            - smart speaker, self-driving car, web search, AI farms and factories
            - one-trick pony but valuable
        - Generative AI
            - Bard, ChatGPT, DALL-E, Midjourney
            - more general purpose
        - AGI - Artificial General Intelligence
            - can do any intellectual task
            - do anything a human can (or more!)
- ANI and Gen Ai - lots of progress
- very far from AGI - not even close but making tiny baby steps in research settings
    - decades or hundreds of years & multiple technological breakthroughs
- in this week, we look at ANI
