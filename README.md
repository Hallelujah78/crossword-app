  <h1>What?</h1>
  </header>
  <p align="left">A web app that allows the user to edit a crossword grid, generate answers programmatically, fetch clues for those answers from OpenAI, save and then solve their crossword.<p>
  <h1>Why?</h1>
  <p align="left">Simply a fun challenge to see if I could generate crosswords programmatically. I discounted the idea of programmaically creating the grid early on. It occurred to me that AI could be used to create the clues, and so that was probably the initial idea that attracted me to the project.</p>

<h1 align="center">Could This Be Useful to You?</h1>
<p>There's an ISSUES.md file that is a brain dump of most of the issues I encountered working on this project. There's also a DEVNOTES.md file that is a kind of a plan, todo, brain dump of my process. Dubious usefulness all round.</p>
<h1 align="center">Getting Started</h1>
- Bootstrapped with Vite so:
  
  - clone it
  - `npm i`
  - `npm run ndev`

- this app uses serverless functions on Netlify. Accessing the app locally with Vite on, for example: localhost:5173/, you will not be able to fetch clues from OpenAI.
- you must access the app locally through the Netlify development server, eg, localhost:8888
- similarly, to access the app on your local network from another device: http://your_dev_machine_ip:8888
